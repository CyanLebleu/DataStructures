# DataStructures
The data strucutres studied at UFSC, Federal University of Santa Catarina.

Contains the classic data structures stack, queu and list, implemented with either with arrays or linked nodes.
the structures were implemented as templates, to assure the dynamic types to be used, and separated in two files, 
header (.hpp) and implementation (.cpp).
These files were coded using the C++11 ISO standard, therefore, if one were going to import it, it might be necessary to rename the .cpp 
files to .ipp (implementation files) depending on your setup.
